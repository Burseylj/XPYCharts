\section{Team Meeting Plan} %Louis
Our team will hold regular meetings on Tuesdays and Thursdays, for about two hours. We will meet either in a free room in MDCL or in the Thode Library
	\par Meetings will be chaired by the person most knowledgeable about the meeting's focus. Team members should come to the meeting with their tasks completed, aware of the current state of the project, and aware of the next steps planned. They should also prepare agenda items that they feel important to discuss. 
	\par The Scribe will take minutes and draft agendas from the items brought by team members and upcoming milestones. Each agenda item should be phrased as a question, and should be unbiased, e.g.\ \textit{What Language Should We Use} is better practice than \textit{Should We Use C++?}.
	\par The meeting should follow the structure of the agenda. Important decisions will ideally be decided by consensus. If a discussion stagnates and moves alloted time without the group reaching a consensus, a decision will be made by vote.
