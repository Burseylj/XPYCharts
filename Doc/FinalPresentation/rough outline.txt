STRUCTURE:
	-Introduction
		* Purpose: Background, usefulness/user base of python, value of a graphing library
		* Scope of the project
	-Discussion
	NON-FUNCTIONALS
		* Important NF requirements, why they're important
		* Learnability, discoverability
			Good error messages
				-users needed more
			Simple api's
			Use our own graphing to display data
		* Portability 
			
		*etc
	FUNCTIONALS
		List off functions, then demo them. Find some interesting data sets to use

		* describe next steps for the project
		
	AUDIENCE QUESTIONS
	
	
	NOTES:
	-Compile everything/make a python script. Don't show code
	-Talk breifly about ways we've improved functionality when applicable
	-Get interesting data set to show how project is useful/"non-trivial"
	
	DONE FOR FRIDAY:
	- Test surveys (for data to graph)
	- Slides
	- Export to png
